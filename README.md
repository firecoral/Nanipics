# Nanipics
A python-based ecommerce web site for ordering greeting cards from custom images.

Nanipics was a web site that DigiProofs built and launched a few years ago.
I architected the site and was one of the two programmers who wrote this code.
We also had a graphics designer for much of the page layout and asset images.

Unfortunately, we didn't have the marketing/advertising budget to properly
promote the site and took it down after it's first holiday season.
